                                    The Northern Luzon Giant Cloud Rat, also known as the Northern Luzon Cloud Rat or simply Cloud Rat, is a remarkable rodent species endemic to the forests of Northern Luzon in the Philippines. It's characterized by its large size, dense fur, and long, bushy tail, making it one of the largest rodents in the world. Despite its size, it's elusive and primarily nocturnal, feeding on a diet of fruits, leaves, and other plant material.

									The Banded Flowerpecker, scientifically known as Dicaeum haematostictum, is a charming little bird found in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
                                     It gets its name from the distinct dark band that runs across its chest. These tiny birds, usually measuring around 8-9 centimeters in length, primarily feed on nectar, fruits, 
                                    and small insects, making them important pollinators and contributors to the ecosystem. They are often spotted in dense forest habitats, where they flit among the foliage in search of food.

While it once inhabited various forested areas across Luzon, including Benguet, habitat loss and fragmentation have made
                                    sightings less common. Conservation efforts are underway to protect remaining populations and their habitats in the region.

									The Baguio Striped Grass Mouse, scientifically known as Mus caroli, is a small rodent species

                                    This mouse is characterized by its distinctive striped fur pattern, which helps it blend into its grassland 
                                    habitat. As an herbivore, it primarily feeds on grasses, seeds, and other plant material found in its environment. 
                                    The Baguio Striped Grass Mouse plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by serving as prey for predators and contributing 
                                    to seed dispersal. However, like many other small mammal species, it faces threats from habitat loss and fragmentation 
                                    due to human activities. Conservation efforts are essential to safeguard the natural habitats of the Baguio Striped Grass
